# Artificial Intelligence for Robotics
Needed to run all files:
- Python 3
- NumPy
- MatPlotLib

This repository represents an effort to introduce myself to the field of robotic intelligence, exploring the subjects:
- Localization (with histogram, Kalman, and particle filters)
- Search
- PID Control
- SLAM
